The dataset you are going to use in this assignment comes from the following source: https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/04/09/the-2019-stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-are-in/ under a ODbL: Open Database License. However, a modified subset of the dataset was provided for this assignment, rather than the dataset from the original source: https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/LargeData/m5_survey_data_demographics.csv and https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/LargeData/m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv  

Project Overview
The information is presented across three interactive dashboards. The first dashboard, titled "Current Technology Usage," utilizes a four-square (2 x 2) layout to display visualizations on the latest tech trends. Similarly, the "Future Technology Trend" dashboard employs the same layout to showcase four visualizations exploring upcoming tech trends. Finally, the "Demographics" dashboard visually categorizes respondent data using a four-square format.
